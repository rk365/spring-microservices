# The purpose of this file is to define a name for this sub-project and
#to set-up the configuration server for which the application will look at.
#conf server will have the details of this discovery server.
#when using Spring Cloud Config Server, you should specify spring.application.name and spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri inside bootstrap.yml
#some encryption/decryption information
#Technically, bootstrap.yml is loaded by a parent Spring ApplicationContext. That parent ApplicationContext is loaded before the one that uses application.yml.
